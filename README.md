## Unlocking plays and bosses

Plays and bosses are also mapped as items to receive and checks to send out but are kept as local checks in their own pool to grant plays in sets that are locked behind gates that open as Sparkle Gems are collected and boss fights are completed. The sytem works as follows:

- The apworld grants the player Set 1, 5 random plays, at leat one of which is an "Act-1" course assuring that at least 1 play at the start has checks that are not locked behind an ensemble

- Upon collecting a predetermined amount of Sparkle Gems, a check called "Boss 1" will be accessible. This check randomly unlocks one of the boss fights (excluding Madame Grape).

- Defeating the boss awards the player with a Darkle Token. Collecting this Darkle Token makes 5 checks called "Set 2 Play 1", "Set 2 Play 2" and so on up to "Set 2 Play 5" accessible. These checks randomly unlock 5 more plays for the player to collect checks in.

- The process repeats with predetermined Sparkle Gem counts that unlock Bosses 2, 3 and 4 and each boss fight granting a Darkle Token and unlocking Sets 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Each of  these sets also contain 5 plays. (after the 4th boss fight 25 out of 30 plays are accessible to the player)

- The remaining 5 plays are granted in set 6 once another predetermined Sparkle Gem count is met

- The final boss and goal, Madam Grape, is unlocked once the player has beaten all 4 bosses and collected their final goal count of Sparkle Gems

- All Sparkle Gem thresholds for unlocking boss fights, Set 6, and Madame Grape are customizable settings in the yaml
